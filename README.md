## The projects were completed as part of "Data Analyst" course at Yandex.Practicum

| Number | Analytical approach | Project title | Project descritpion | Tech stack used |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 1 | Data preprocessing | [A study of bank customers reliability](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_2_Credit_Score) | The customer is the credit department of the bank. It is necessary to determine whether the marital status and the number of children affect the clients' timely loan repayment. Input data from the bank is the statistics on the clients' solvency. The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model, a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to the bank. | Python, Pandas |
| 2 | Exploratory data analysis | [Real estate market analysis](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_3_Real_estate) | Determination of the market value of real estate objects (based on the resource database https://realty.yandex.ru). The task is to establish parameters that have an impact on the final cost. This will allow to create an automated system, that will track anomalies and fraudulent activity. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib |
| 3 | Statistical data analysis | [Determination of a profitable mobile plan for a telecom company based on customer data](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_4_Telecom) | Analysis of the mobile plans of a telecommunication company. It is necessary to analyze customer behavior and draw a conclusion, which mobile plan is better. In this project, I formulate a null and an alternative hypothesis to test the average revenue between mobile plans and regions. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, SciPy, descriptive statistics, statistical hypothesis testing |
| 4 | Combination project | [A study of the video games industry](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_5_Games) | An analysis for a video games online store for consoles and computers. It is necessary to identify the patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow us to make a bid for a potentially popular game and plan the advertising campaigns. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, SciPy, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, descriptive statistics, statistical hypothesis testing |
| 5 | Data collection and storage | [Airline analytics](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_6_Airline) | For two datasets: import files, examine thei data, check data types for correctness, choose the top 10 cities by the number of flights, build graphs: aircraft models and the number of flights, cities and the number of flights, top 10 cities and the number of flights; draw conclusions on each of the graphs, explain the result. Build graphs: aircraft models and the number of flights, cities and the number of flights, top 10 cities and the number of flights. Draw conclusions on each of the graphs, explain the results. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL, SciPy, hypotheses testing |
| 6 | Business performance analysis | [Optimization of marketing costs for a service aggregator company](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_7_Web_Service) | Internship in the analytics department of Yandex.Afisha. Objective: Help marketers optimize marketing costs. Calculation of business metrics: Retention rate, Churn Rate, LTV, CAC, ROMI. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, cohort analysis, visualization of results, Retetion Rate, LTV, CAC, ROI. |
