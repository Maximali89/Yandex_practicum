| Number | Analytical approach | Project title | Project descritpion | Tech stack used |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 1 | Data preprocessing | [A study of bank customers reliability](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_2_Credit_Score) | The customer is the credit department of the bank. It is necessary to determine whether the marital status and the number of children affect the clients' timely loan repayment. Input data from the bank is the statistics on the clients' solvency. The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model, a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to the bank. | Python, Pandas |
| 2 | Exploratory data analysis | [Real estate market analysis](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_3_Real_estate) | Determination of the market value of real estate objects (based on the resource database https://realty.yandex.ru). The task is to establish parameters that have an impact on the final cost. This will allow to create an automated system, that will track anomalies and fraudulent activity. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib |
| 3 | Statistical data analysis | [Determination of a profitable mobile plan for a telecom company based on customer data](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_4_Telecom) | Analysis of the mobile plans of a telecommunication company. It is necessary to analyze customer behavior and draw a conclusion, which mobile plan is better. In this project, I formulate a null and an alternative hypothesis to test the average revenue between mobile plans and regions. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, SciPy, descriptive statistics, statistical hypothesis testing |
| 4 | Combination project | [A study of the video games industry](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_5_Games) | An analysis for a video games online store for consoles and computers. It is necessary to identify the patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow us to make a bid for a potentially popular game and plan the advertising campaigns. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, SciPy, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, descriptive statistics, statistical hypothesis testing |
| 5 | Data collection and storage | [Airline analytics](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_6_Airline) | For two datasets: import files, examine thei data, check data types for correctness, choose the top 10 cities by the number of flights, build graphs: aircraft models and the number of flights, cities and the number of flights, top 10 cities and the number of flights; draw conclusions on each of the graphs, explain the result. Build graphs: aircraft models and the number of flights, cities and the number of flights, top 10 cities and the number of flights. Draw conclusions on each of the graphs, explain the results. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL, SciPy, hypotheses testing |
| 6 | Business performance analysis | [Optimization of marketing costs for a service aggregator company](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_7_Web_Service) | Internship in the analytics department of Yandex.Afisha. Objective: Help marketers optimize marketing costs. Calculation of business metrics: Retention rate, Churn Rate, LTV, CAC, ROMI. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, cohort analysis, visualization of results, Retetion Rate, LTV, CAC, ROI. |
| 7 | Analysis of the AB test results | [Data-Driven Decision Making. Hypothesis prioritization, A/B test](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_8_A-B_Test) | You are a large online store analyst. Together with the marketing department, you have prepared a list of hypotheses for increasing revenue. Task are to prioritize the hypotheses, run an A/B test, and analyze the results. Apply ICE, RICE frameworks. Build cumulative conversion rates. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Hypothesis prioritization (ICE, RICE), A/B test (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test) |
| 8 | Preparing data for presentation | [Moscow catering market](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_9_Restaurants) | Study of a project for investors to open a small cafe in Moscow. The task of this project is to conduct a market a market research for the catering industry in Moscow in order to determine which type of restaurant would be successful. The project's plan is to use robot waiters instead of traditional human waiters. [Study presentation](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AkOle23cUbde8ksgoTsI3D19GbkI?e=tqVghP) | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, RegEx, external data access |
| 9 | Combination project-2 | [AAB Tests](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_10_A-A-B_test_app) | AAB testing, multiple testing and application of corrections to the results obtained. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, A/B testing, Statistical Hypotheses Testing, Product Metrics, Event Analytics |
| 10 | Automatization | [Dashboard for the Yandex.Zen project](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_11_Dashboard) | The project implies the creation of a dashboard for managers in order to automate the process of tracking user interaction with Yandex.Zen cards. | Python, Pandas, Tableau, MS PowerPoint |
| 11 | Forecasts and predictions | [Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/Maximali89/Yandex_practicum/tree/main/Sprint_12_Gym_Churn) | The fitness chain is developing an analytics-driven user experience strategy. The task of the project is to analyze and prepare an action plan for customer retention. In this project, based on the metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC_AUC, you need to choose a suitable forecasting model from two trained ones: LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier. It is also required to do clustering on the basis of the constructed dendogram and, on the basis of the obtained clusters, build distribution histograms, from which I draw conclusions and forecasts. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Sklearn, SciPy |
