## A study of an airline data

*Tech stack used: **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL, SciPy, hypotheses testing***

### Description of the project

Part of the work was carried out in the SQL simulator, so it is not presented here (unloading and preparing airline data using SQL. Testing of hypotheses about the difference in the average demand for tickets during various events). There was a need to determine the intensity of use of the company's aircraft and analyze the distribution of flights by cities in Russia. And also identify the TOP-10 cities in terms of the number of arrivals.

### Data preprocessing
* Data validation for correctness (types, missing values, duplicates)
* Determination of the top 10 cities by the number of flights
* Data visualization and interpreting of results by aircraft models
  * aircraft models and number of flights
  * cities and number of flights
  * TOP-10 cities and number of flights

### Analysis results

* The majority of flights are short or medium-haul flight.
* TOP-3 most used aircraft:
  * Cessna 208 Caravan (4557 flights)
  * Bombardier CRJ-200 (4446 flights)
  * Sukhoi SuperJet-100	(4185 flights)
* Regular flights to 101 cities in Russia
* The TOP-10 cities by the number of flights included large cities, industrial centers of large regions and Sochi (touristic destination)
* The TOP-3 cities by the number of flights are Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk.
